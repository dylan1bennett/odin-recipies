                Lasagna is by far the best Italian plate in the world, here is why. The taste of it is amazing there are many ways to describe it. Such as the cheesy warm goodness of the taste that makes it amazing. Also the salty pasta layers it has, and can also add hot sauce to give it a little spice. Not to mention the look of the plate. The brown meat and the red tomato sauce looks mouth watering to anyone who has taste buds.

            <h5>Instructions:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                    <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
                    <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>

                <details>We like to eat out one night a week, usually on the weekends. Last week we ordered a pizza and had it delivered. It cost about $20 total, and I ended up being a little mad at myself because making homemade pizza is so much cheaper, and I always have the ingredients I need. Not only is it cheap to make from home, but with my homemade pizza dough recipe, and the right toppings, it’s just as good as anything you’d buy at a restaurant!</details>
                <h5>Instructions:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Preheat your oven to 450 degrees F.</li>
                        <li>Pre-bake your pizza dough for 6 minutes then top your prebaked pizza dough with a thin layer of pizza sauce.</li>
                        <li>Then add a thin layer of mozzarella cheese, a layer of pepperoni, and sprinkle another thin layer of cheese on top of the pepperoni.</li>
                        <li>Bake at 450 F for 10 -15 minutes or until crust is golden brown and cheese is bubbly.</li>

                <details>Easy weeknight friendly spaghetti and meat sauce that’s made completely from scratch. Use ground beef, turkey, pork, chicken or lamb to make this simple spaghetti recipe.</details>
                <H5>Instructions:</H5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven). Add the meat and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. As the meat cooks, use a wooden spoon to break it up into smaller crumbles.</li>
                        <li>Add the onions and cook, stirring every once and a while, until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring continuously for about 1 minute.</li>
                        <li>Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of meat or onion stuck to the bottom of the pot. Stir in the tomatoes, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and a generous pinch of black pepper. Bring the sauce to a low simmer. Cook, uncovered, at a low simmer for 25 minutes. As it cooks, stir and taste the sauce a few times so you can adjust the seasoning accordingly (see notes for suggestions).</li>
                        <li>About 15 minutes before the sauce finishes cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to the boil, and then cook pasta according to package directions, but check for doneness a minute or two before the suggested cooking time.</li>
                        <li>Take the sauce off of the heat, and then stir in the basil. Toss in the cooked pasta, and then leave for a minute so that the pasta absorbs some of the sauce. Toss again, and then serve with parmesan sprinkled on top.</li>
                    </ul>
